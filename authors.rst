**Scott Baker** is a Cloud Software Architect at Intel, which he
joined as part of Intel's acquisition of the Open Networking
Foundation (ONF) engineering team. While at ONF, he led the Aether
DevOps team. Prior to ONF, he worked on cloud-related research
projects at Princeton and the University of Arizona, including
PlanetLab, GENI, and VICCI. Baker received his Ph.D. in Computer
Science from the University of Arizona in 2005.

**Andy Bavier** is a Cloud Software Engineer at Intel, which he joined
as part of Intel's acquisition of the Open Networking Foundation (ONF)
engineering team. While at ONF, he worked on the Aether project. Prior
to joining ONF, he was a Research Scientist at Princeton University,
where he worked on the PlanetLab project. Bavier received a BA in
Philosophy from William & Mary in 1990, and MS in Computer Science
from the University of Arizona in 1995, and a PhD in Computer Science
from Princeton University in 2004.

**Zack Williams** is a Cloud Software Engineer at Intel, which he
joined as part of Intel's acquisition of the Open Networking
Foundation (ONF) engineering team. While at ONF, he worked on the
Aether project, and led the Infrastructure team. Prior to joining ONF,
he was a systems programmer at the University of Arizona. Williams
received his BS in Computer Science from the University of Arizona
in 2001.

**Bruce Davie** is a computer scientist noted for his contributions to
the field of networking. He is a former VP and CTO for the Asia
Pacific region at VMware. He joined VMware during the acquisition of
Software Defined Networking (SDN) startup Nicira. Prior to that, he
was a Fellow at Cisco Systems, leading a team of architects
responsible for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). Davie has over
30 years of networking industry experience and has co-authored 17
RFCs. He was recognized as an ACM Fellow in 2009 and chaired ACM
SIGCOMM from 2009 to 2013. He was also a visiting lecturer at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for five years. Davie is the
author of multiple books and the holder of more than 40 U.S. Patents.
